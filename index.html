				Ichalkaranji was a Maratha princely state situated on the banks of Panchganga River (Marathi: पंचगंगा नदी). It was ruled by a Chitpavan Brahmin Ghorpade family for two centuries until 1947. The dynasty of Maratha rulers of Ichalkaranji has its origin in the middle of the seventeenth century. At that time, a poor Brahmin widow, by the surname of Joshi, from the coastal Konkan village of Mhapan, near Vengurla, in the present-day Sindhudurg district, moved east over the mountainous Western ghats with her seven-year-old son, Naro Mahadeo, to the village of Kapshi. The Maratha general Santaji Ghorpade, hailed from that village. Naro Mahadeo early took a keen interest in the cavalry horses of the general and one day persuaded a syce to allow him to ride a fiery warhorse to the river to drink water. This stolen ride was observed by the alert Santaji, who roundly scolded the syce, but also began to take a deep interest in the prodigal boy, who rode so well without any formal training. Benefited by the general's personal attention. Naro, in turn, served Santaji loyally and both developed affection for each other. Naro performed heroically and gallantly. As Naro Mahadeo proved his ability, he was promoted and later on was rewarded with tax collecting fiefs(Inams). Out of gratitude to his benefactor, Naro went on to change his surname from Joshi to Ghorpade, which to this day is the surname of the dynasty of rulers of Ichalkaranji.

				<p style="text-align: justify;width: 50% float:right;">
					Narayanrao Babasaheb was the eighth ruler. He ascended the seat in the year 1892. His rule was marked with progressive measures in all departments of the administration. As a young man, he had a very well-rounded and advanced education, making it a point to select those subjects which would be of special benefit in administrative affairs. In addition, he had traveled far and wide, visiting Java, Malay Peninsula, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Burma. He had also visited England and the Continent three times. He took a keen interest in the cultural as well as material and social welfare of his people. He patronized the study of art and Indian classical music, from basic to the advanced stages, also offering prizes in the art exhibitions at Pune and Mumbai. He established scholarships in several art colleges of Maharashtra and for students going abroad for their professional education. Shrimant Narayanrao Babasaheb was a patron of culture and an enlightened ruler.[1] Narayanrao Babasaheb Ghorpade was responsible for developing the Ichalkaranji City into an industrial town.[2] He was the main source of inspiration for the development of both the decentralized textile industry as well as the co-operative movement. He encouraged Vitthalrao Datar, a young entrepreneur of the town, to install a power loom in 1904. The foresighted ruler gave royal patronage by extending financial assistance as well as free land to the weavers and other enterprising entrepreneurs. During his visit to Denmark and other western countries, the chief had access to the co-operative sector of these countries and was impressed with their success. On his return to India, he vowed to exercise this movement for the benefit of his subjects, to reform the microeconomics of the town for prosperity, growth and Self-sustainability of the society.

				<h2>Ramling Temple</h2>
				<img src="Ramling.jpg" style="float: left;margin: 18px">
				<p style="text-align: justify;width: 50% float:right;">
					Ramling Temple near Hatkanangale town of Kolhapur is an ancient and beautiful cave temple from the Ramayana period and is famous for the myth that Lord Rama resided here during his fourteen-year exile. The temple is located on a hill on the Sangli-Kolhapur road, next to Aalte village at a distance of 23km and can be reached after a half hour drive. 
					The structure of the temple is quite old and the main idol is a ‘Shivling’ inside the cave. Mahadev Gurav, priest of the Ramling temple, said, “It is believed that this Shivling is placed here by Lord Rama during his exile in the forests for 14 years. The cave was first discovered in 1906 by a saint travelling through this region.” 
					The cave temple of Ramling is carved out of a rocky hill.
					Mahadev Nalavade, famous as ‘Maharaj’ in the temple area, said the main cave was around 12 ft square, but almost three-fourth part of it has been turned into a kind of water tank now. After entering the temple, a beautiful rock-carved ling and idols of Ganpati, Parvati devi and Veerbhadra can be seen. Outside the cave, a massive Hemadpanti structure of 13ft rests on stone pillars. By the side of the main cave is a row of seven small cells dedicated to the seven Puranic sages or Sapta rishis. The temple also has two 'Nandi' in its sanctum, which is very rare sight in Indian temples.’ 
					The caves are always wet because of the water flowing over the walls all the time. The quantity of water coming into the cave increases during rainy season, but the source of water has not been identified. The structures around this temple are ancient. 
					Ramling temple is a classic combination of natural beauty and architectural excellence. Hritik Kumthekar, visitor at the temple, said, “A memorizing temple carved entirely in the hill stones within the dark woods offers extremely enchanting atmosphere to the visitors. The place stays crowded with monkeys all the time and people offer them food imagining them as form of Lord Hanuman.”<br>
